                    <p>var: It is not a block scope and is hoisted. They can be used before they are declared, but
                        initially it will be set as undefined.</p>
                    <p>let: It is not hoisted and has a block scope. You are unable to use them before declaring them
                        because they are only available within the block.</p>
                    <p>const: Has no hoisting and has a block scope.Furthermore, once a value is set for a const
                        variable, it cannot be changed because they are constant.</p>

                    Tell us the use cases of null and undefined?

                    <p>null: This is usually used as a placeholder for an object that is not initialized or does not
                        exist, or to purposefully indicate the lack of any object value.</p>
                    <p>Undefined: Indicates that a variable or property does not have a defined value. When a variable
                        or property in JavaScript is declared but not given a value, it frequently has a default
                        value. It might also mean that a function isn't returning any values.</p>
                    <p>One important use case can be: When a value is expected but not supplied, or when you need to
                        verify whether a variable or property has been initialized, use undefined; otherwise, use
                        null to expressly declare that a variable or object property has no value.</p>

                        design principles is known as a REST API. <br>In real life, a REST API functions in the same
                        manner as any website. Data is returned over the HTTP protocol once a call is placed from a
                        client to a server.
